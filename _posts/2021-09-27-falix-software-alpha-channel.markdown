In effort to conduct additional testing on Falix Software, an alpha channel has been established for users to test upcoming releases of Falix Software.
Why? We encountered some hiccups during delivery for all platforms, especially macOS and Windows, in the most recent minor version, v3.4.0, which added security measures. This is due to insufficient testing to assure the quality and experience of Falix Software consumers.

Along with it, a new page called Sandbox was added to the Settings. This section is mostly used for testing functions such as dialog boxes, notifications, and others.
Expect a beta channel as well in the future.

Microsoft Store will not receive an alpha or beta channel.
